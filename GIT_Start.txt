This is my first file to be pushed and commit in my porfolio repository
fun fact that while doing git init it will show error if the name of the folder was not the same as the name of the repository
so this is my second time trying to push something to the repsitory
lets do this
so here is an update that the first time i tried was also correct the only fault was my brain lol.
so .git file was a hidden file so to see in linux you have to press ctrl+h to unhide the file
its not necessary to always see the .git file but just to confirm that our git is initailized or not
so its done
another thing...
while pushing, now git doesn't accept the normal password you have to generate token from github website account
go to your github account and go to the settings then go to the developers settings then goo to personal access token
then generate one token copy the link of the token and while pushing when git asks for password paste that into the password
here you go it'll work for sure
and to update something, basically if you changed something in your file and you want that it should be done in my github repository also then you have to start from adding that file than commit it then push it.
Git pull command is used to pull a repository
git branch will make a new branch and benifit of branching is that until you merge each branch will contain different updated content and if you merge the branches then it will update the content
